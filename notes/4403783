      <text>It seems the paths have changed a little in this area, some have been reclaimed by nature with persistent mini-ponds. I used to avoid it in fall-winter due to muddiness, but now it was even overflown in August 2024 when I ran by. Some other informal paths seem to have come into existence from people trying to push their way through on other sides. Would need a proper GPS survey (and decision whether it is a one summer flooding kind of thing or the new normal on that path), but I cannot do it due to not living in the area any more.</text>

      <text>I am afraid you have created one more note that is doomed to stay open for several years.

There are way too many open notes on the map, this is discouraging for everyone.

May I suggest we close it after a few weeks if no-one expressed any interest to execute your request to survey it..

Please understand that we are volunteers; while we are always willing to contribute, we want to make sure we're prioritising our efforts on tasks that will have the most significant impact on anyone using the map.</text>

      <text>Sure thing, if you think that's what is best. Thanks for all the work you put into Brussels OSM!</text>

      <text>I rode my bike here yesterday. All the paths that are on OSM are still there in the field. Generally more overgrown than I've ever seen them though.
Specifically at the location of the pin, `smoothness=very_horrible` is quite accurate. Only for experienced mtb'ers or people on foot with wellies. As Ward somewhat suggests, I think it is indeed on purpose/policy that they try to keep the water table as high as possible here. I propose I'll update some of the landcover according to latest imagery and put the smoothness tag on this specific stretch.</text>
