      <text>are you asking this question to somebody in particular? I don't think it's very likely that somebody else will pass by here soon to survey. How did you solve the other notes in the surroundings?</text>

      <text>Strava heat map doesn't show a track, so it is not very probably. If you (or someone) checks, please check the paths in the north-east of the forest too. They are private, which is strange.</text>
