      <text>Strange if "cycleway" is so bad that tourism put it on cycling node trajectory ? 5-39 Is it all the way ?</text>

      <text>Hi, first of all it's an old notification from autumn 2022, I failed to create an account during my bike tour. Second I recall the track condition was mainly bad because of the weather, there was some rain before. But still, beautiful area but pretty difficult track, especially when riding luggage for several days.</text>

      <text>(1) Any update from tourism?
(2) I went walking here twice during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it was indeed a dirt path that could get muddy at times. Not suitable for all types of bikes. I don't know the current situation, though.</text>

      <text>I happened to use this path last week. It really is a path that is only comfortable on a mountain bike. As I was entering it, people in front of us were making an about-turn because it was too hard for them.
This entire section is affected:
https://www.openstreetmap.org/directions?engine=graphhopper_foot&amp;route=50.39334%2C5.53400%3B50.38132%2C5.52437
All of it has some clarifying tags about path quality, so I'm not sure we should do anything more? Since it is part of the PreRavel network, I guess cycleway isn't that bad?</text>
