      <text>This is marked as private, but I can't find any info which proves that it actually is. Can someone check if this is an incorrect tag or not? RouteYou users say they can go over it, but I'm not sure if that means they're allowed to or if its just possible to do it.</text>

      <text>I've been there quite a few times. IIRC, there are indeed some signs about this being private property, but they are posted in such a way that it looks like you shouldn't go off the paths, not so much that you aren't allowed to use the paths. Anyway, I think only the municipality will be able to give a final answer. It's definitely not a chemin vecinal, see https://chemins.be/carte
