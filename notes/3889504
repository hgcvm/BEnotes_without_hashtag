shop=ruitersportwinkel ? What is the meaning of that shop value? What kind of services or products are sold here? Is anything from https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:shop fitting? Maybe new value needs to be invented? Maybe this data is wrong and there is no shop here? Maybe it is not a shop but something else?</text>

      <text>Dear Mateusz, 
Ruitersport is the Dutch language word for horseback riding - although they may also sell stuff for pony, donkey, camel, dromedary and elephant riders. Mapillary only shows the N10 major road, Google doesn't yield much either, and just a mobile number leaves me wondering; 

Without having actually seen their product lines, my impression is that the description at https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:shop%3Dequestrian would cover their activities - if they're still in business ; have amended, but might need checking on the ground - bit far to ride bicycle from where I live, though, thus 'FIXME' re. existence? </text>
