      <text>I don't think that access=private is appropirate here ; the signs say that the parking is reserved for residents and users of the convenience but nothing indicate there is no access allowed , otherwise how to reach the playground and the "Maison de quartier" ? Probably motor_vehicle=private is more appropriate.  For anothers services roads around need to check what is signed or not (i just spotted this one)</text>

      <text>You are probably right.

The mapper who added access=private is very active, so you might want to get in touch with him and ask for an opinion.
