      <text>RouteYou user says a bridge crossing the "Zwarte Beek en Demer" near Diest is closed for all traffic, but he isn't really clear as to which bridge this actually is. Anyone with local knowledge who can add the correct access tags to the correct bridge?</text>

      <text>I've surveyed this recently, but haven't updated OSM yet since I'm on holidays now. The closure is part of a large reconstruction project of the area, to be able to better cope with floods and strengthen the walls, etc.</text>

      <text>I mapped the current situation in changeset 155588687, however, follow-up is necessary since this path will reopen at some point and other paths might be closed as well. I pass through Diest a few times a year, will try and survey it again when I pass there.</text>
