      <text>I have remapped the police station here as offices. It looks like the offices moved to https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/97441737/ and this building is just used as an office now.</text>

      <text>Sorry, my note is a little vague. The point is that the "downgrade" from police station to offices was only a deduction from what limited info I could find online. The building could have another use now, or maybe I'm just wrong. Feel free to close.</text>
