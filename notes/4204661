      <text>I only tagged it with “survey needed” because Jean-Louis specifically asked for a survey. Hashtags are used for categorisation of notes; see https://hackmd.io/@osmbe/ryJ3yB2-C.</text>

      <text>That's a very good question. Maybe the other end of the path to see where it ends?

In any case, if Jean-Louis doesn't reply here within a reasonable time, I suggest we close the note.</text>

      <text>If you're certain you will be able to survey this yourself, I suggest closing the note. Notes can be a good way of following up on a situation, but it's unlikely someone will coincidentially pass here.</text>
