      <text>It seems like the situation here has recently changed, this track seems to be more like a service highway now and likely was also moved a bit, the sand areas are probably gone or got turned into shingle, etc. I already connected the service highway on the embankment to the track, as they are connected now, but don't remember enough details to update much more.</text>
