      <text>Friday i added 3 POI on mobile with level -1 as indicated on this elevator i have taken : https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/11124711253/history

when checking now with Josm i see that the indoor footway i have take is indicated to be -2 in osm  : https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/513669186/history  (V4 seems more correct) idem for the escalator going to the metro. It's clearly indicated on the elevator that metro level is -2. 

Maybe SNCB use another level tagging but in that case where is the reference ? I just taken this entrance and not checked another one. 

Less problematic ; i have the impression that https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/1199403256/history is a little bit more to the north</text>

      <text>I have checked all the elevator that connect at same time SNCB and Stib and they all indicate -1 for sncb and -2 for stib : https://www.mapillary.com/app/?lat=50.8433882&amp;lng=4.3805516&amp;z=19.9&amp;pKey=369076086265429&amp;focus=photo&amp;x=0.4882536740574941&amp;y=0.35384446281284304&amp;zoom=0 

I know now why user put a different level labelling : the technical room inside station SNCB are indicated -2 and STIB -3 but it's not a public indication just for technician , and to complicate more https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/7982305392 that deserve Only SNCB platform 3 indicate -1 ;-/ </text>

      <text>You are raising a good (but difficult) point here:

In the current system, the underground corridor near Berlaymont has level -1 (https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/480855836), all 4 railway platforms have -2 and the metro has -3.  That seems to be correct, because the corridor I mentioned is physically higher than the railway platform.

Sometimes we must ignore the numbering system used by operators if that is the only possibility to create a functioning routable structure. The drawback is that it makes it impossible to exclusively use OSM data to feed apps that say: "Take the elevator to level -2."

Alternatively, we can try a 0;-1;-2 system and get the landings to be at level -1.5 and so on, but we’ll need to be sure that there won’t be too many complicated cases.

Surveying more parts of this station is still on my to-do mountain.</text>

      <text>Indeed 480855836 is correct as "base reference" follows from this all the other levels are correct. 

So for my first concern about POI correct level is -2 even elevator indicate something else. 

I just looked whet "Carto’Cité" used for their mapping of SNCF stations and they add https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:level:ref 
(they used for indoor=level) but i think that can resolve a lot of that case in Brussels Metro 

Simple Indoor Tagging wiki page say : "the number or code of the level. This models the level numbering scheme as it is displayed in the building itself, e.g. on floor plans or elevator buttons, which may be different from the level=* value. " 

Do you think it's a good solution ?
