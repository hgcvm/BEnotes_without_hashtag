      <text>Check surroundings: aerial imagery suggests a bridge near Salve Mater buildings, and it is unclear from imagery whether the bent path near St Vincentius actually meets the Groot Park service street or has a fence / bends further</text>

      <text>Surveyed today, most paths and service roads were closed due to works, so it was impossible to verify.</text>

      <text>Surveyed again today, made some improvements in changeset 153979332, however a further survey would be necessary after the works have finished, as a major area is still closed. There's no indication on site as to when the works will finish.</text>
